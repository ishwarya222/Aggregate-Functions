# Aggregate-Functions
Aggregate functions are used in databases to perform calculations on a group of records and return a single result. They help summarize data by finding total, average, minimum, maximum, or count values. Common aggregate functions include COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX, and they are widely used in data analysis and reporting.
